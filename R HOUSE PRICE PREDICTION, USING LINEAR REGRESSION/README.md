🏠 House Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the House Price Prediction Project, where we teach machines to understand what makes a house worth the price tag! If only predicting the housing market in real life were this simple, right? This project showcases how we can use machine learning to estimate house prices with Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

📊 Project Overview

What's Going On?
Our goal is to predict house prices based on historical data and a mix of variables like size, location, and a sprinkle of mathematical magic. This project uses a well-known public housing dataset to bring data science to life, transforming numbers into insights that even real estate agents might envy (if only a little).

Project Workflow
Extract: Load the dataset into R, capturing essential info like square footage and neighborhood data.
Transform: Give our data a makeover with cleaning, feature engineering, and selection steps to get it model-ready.
Load: Finally, we use this transformed data to train and test two models, complete with visuals to show how they perform.
🛠️ Tools & Libraries

We keep things simple but effective:

tidyverse for data wrangling and plotting.
randomForest for building a random forest model (our data's best friend).
ggplot2 for our visualization needs because, as they say, a picture’s worth a thousand tables.
dplyr for filtering, mutating, and all those delightful data tricks.
🚀 Running the Project

Clone the Repository: Grab the code and dataset from this repo.
Load the Dataset: Bring in the housing.data file to your R environment.
Run the R Script: Fire up the House_Price_Prediction_Using.R script, sit back, and let R do the heavy lifting.
Visualize Results: The script will output two snazzy plots (house_price_prediction_lr.jpg and house_price_prediction_rf.jpg) showing how well the models did in their price predictions.
🧩 The ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load)

The ETL process here takes us from raw numbers to real insights:

Extract: Load up the housing data.
Transform: Clean the data, engineer features like volatility, and prepare everything for the models.
Load: Use the polished dataset to train the models and save the results.
📈 Outputs

Linear Regression Plot: Shows actual vs. predicted prices using linear regression, our “straightforward” model.
Random Forest Plot: Compares actual vs. predicted prices using random forest—because sometimes, it takes a forest to see the (data) trees.
Each plot lets us see how close the predictions are to the actual values, giving us a feel for model accuracy. It’s like a mini crystal ball, but for houses!
